# online-shop

I start coding this online shop about a week ago for practicing ** django **

## What is a bit special in this Online-Shop :
### * Custom User Model 
### * Sending message in telegram shop channel when a new product saved
### * can send an UNKOWN e-mail via site to owner of the site (gamer.good1400@gmail.com)
### * Using jazzadmin to make admin-panel beautiful 
### * More Button, when you click on it, it loads more products by fetching api (JSfetch/AJEX/RestAPI)
### * Category option, you can request to see products with by example sport categories (http://127.0.0.1:8000/categories/?category=sport)
### * LogIn SignUp by Phone-number

by now just this
but ill update it later...
